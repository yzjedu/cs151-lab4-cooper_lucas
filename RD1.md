1. One of the challenges we encountered were the test cases. To complete the test cases there were many 
if and else statements which made it more difficult to complete. Another challenge we faced was that the 
first algorithm commit did not push correctly leading me to have to remake the algorithm off of the code we had.
2. We followed the 3 rules of programming by first reading the read me and creating the algorithm based off 
if it. Further we completed the test cases to further understand the algorithm while we were making it. We
then went to code based on the algorithm which was quite easy, I read the algorithm while Cooper typed 
the code. We then tested each pathway to make sure it worked.
3. I first worked on the test cases then Cooper finished editing them. Rewriting the algorithm was not that 
hard, I was able to base the new algorithm on what we did and check to make sure what we coded was
correct.
4. One takeaway was how to better code with if and else statements as well as how to implement them in 
excel for test cases
5. I think I did learn what I should have learned for this lab.
6. Working with Cooper was good. He was smart and understood the assignment well, allowing us to 
complete the lab effectively as a team. We were able to bounce ideas off of each other to solve the task
well.
