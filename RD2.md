**Objective:**
- What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?

We were supposed to get practice with string methods and formatting, decision making, input validation with loops, and writing our own algorithms, flowcharts, and control paths before coding.


**Procedure:**
- What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?

We tried to follow all the steps listed in the README file. We used techniques such as making inputs lowercase to make sure every version of the word would work.

- What were the Key concepts explored?

The key concepts explored were string methods and formatting, decision making, input validation with loops, and writing algorithms, flowcharts, and control paths.


**Results:**
- Did your results match what you expected to get?

The results seemed to match what we expected to get.

- Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?

We tried using various test cases.


**Reflection:**
- What challenges did you encounter?

It took a while to remember how to make a word lowercase, and it was very time-consuming to do all of the if statements.

- How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?

We thought and discussed before programming, made the program understandable, and practiced our skills while making the program.

- Did you overcome them, and how?

We looked back at past assignments to see how we did things in the past, then used that knowledge to do this assignment.

- Any key takeaways?

It can be helpful to refer to past works to decide how to do something in a current work.

- Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?

I think I learned what I was supposed to learn.

- What was it like working with your partner?

Working with Lucas was great. We managed to get most of the work done in our lab time because we were able to discuss solutions and come to a common understanding.
